# MobileGame
A Game made Using Xamarin Forms

The purpose of this README is to explain the architecture of the Git Repo.

*First and foremost it is important to understand that I developed this game to make use of the device sensors of an android device.
Keeping the cross-platform development architecture in mind I have added handling so the game can be deployed as a UWP app, however to enjoy the experience as intented by me I think it is important to play this game on an android device.* 

The [Code](https://github.com/cormacmchale/MobileGame) section contains the source code of the application as well as the design document
that had the project plan at the beginning. Slight changes were made to this towards the end of the project so as to give the over-all project a consistant feel but I am content I stuck to the guidance of this document for the most part. Also here you will find the buisness Requirements for the application as well as the test plan with results.

The [Issues](https://github.com/cormacmchale/MobileGame/issues) section is developer orientated. It contains (in my opinion) fairly extensive documentation on the problems I faced during the development. Each issue was closed when I had found a solution or was happy with a work-around. Any help I got from threads or tutorials I have linked inside the issue where applicable. The issues are not overly formal and contain my thoughts on the problems/solutions aswell as screenshots of how I tried to solve the problem in the source code. The open issues are ones that still haven't been solved due to time constraints on the upload on this project. I will return to these after the project has been reviewed.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/cormacmchale/MobileGame/wiki) section is User oriented and explains the Layout of the app along with screen shots of how it should look on either UWP and Android. An explanation of how to play will also be included along with how the app should expect to perform for a User with no programming experience.
