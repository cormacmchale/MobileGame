# MobileGame
A Game made Using Xamarin Forms

The purpose of this README is to explain the architecture of the Git Repo.

*First and foremost it is important to understand that I developed this game to make use of the device sensors of an android device.
Keeping the cross-platform development in mind I have added handling so the game can be deployed as a UWP app, however to enjoy the 
experience as intented by me I think it is important to play this game on an android device.* 

The [Code](https://github.com/cormacmchale/MobileGame) section contains the source code of the application as well as the design document
that had the project plan at the beginning. Slight changes were made towards the end of the project so as to give the over-all project
a consistant feel but over-all I am content I stuck to the guidance of this document. Also here you will find the buisness Requirements for
the application as well as the test plan with results.
